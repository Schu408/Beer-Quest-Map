Hello, fellow contenders of the pubcrawl event 2025!

We welcome you to join us on our journey of trying out all the local breweries in Kingsland towards eden terrace. I would like to thank you for your participation here.
The key destinations are the following:
 - Beer spot
 - Urbanaut
 - St Leonards
 - Garage Project
 - Churly's
 - Galbraith's
These are the core craft places so feel free to focus on those drop locations should you wish to just sample some of their fine beer!

We will start off from Morningside and make our way up towards CBD. Here is the plan for the day:
Due to the mapping of the dinner locations, we will have a slower pacing for the first few pubs just to give some time for others to catch up to us should they be late!
 - The Beer Spot: 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm
 - The Tapping Room: 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
 - Urbanaut: 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm
 - Portland Public House (dinner): 5:00 - 6:20 pm
 - We speed up here
 - St Leonards: 6:20 pm - 7:10 pm
 - Garage Project: 7:10 pm - 8:00 pm
 - Churly's: 8:00 pm - 8:50 pm
 - Galbraith's: 8:50 pm - 9:40 pm
 - Schapiro's (Breather): 9:40 pm ---
   
After this, if we have the energy we will slowly walk into town and drop by some pubs. If we can get to caretakers (and they let us in) then we win!

For the massive buzzkill, I do need to lay out the ground rules for this event.
One drink or One paddle per brewery. (paddle adds up to 1 - 1.5 pints depending on how generous the servers are).
If you are ever stopped from service then your drinking journey ends here! Feel free to walk along if you want.
If you decide to get too comfortable and don't want to continue then that's fine! The main group will try to continue without you.
Please do watch the road... We do need to cross it a few times.
